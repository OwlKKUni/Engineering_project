Pipeline - chain of processing elements (processes, threads, functions, etc.), where the output of each element is the input of the next

YOU CANT RUN GPU ON TENSORFLOW VERSION > 2.10
Tensorflow 2.10 requires python v3.10 -> I am using v3.11

Order of running:
#1 run get_images.py
#2 run load_images_into_a_pipeline.py
#3 run random_move_files.py and move_labels.py
#4 run augment_all_pictures.py
#5

This thing takes nearly 10 minutes per epoch on train set
